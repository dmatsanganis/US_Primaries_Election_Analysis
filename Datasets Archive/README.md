All the datasets created and/or used during this analysis (and the ones to relate the county_facts with the votes
Excel sheets), as well as the provided one, can be found on the Datasets Archive file. These are the followings:

states and the fips codes but with the addition of the county variable (data points based on
counties), us_elections_2016_clustering.csv
